# TactiTrack: 🚀 Recruiting Developers! Let's Build an Open-Source Football Heatmap Analysis Tool Together!  

Hello everyone!

I am developing an **open-source football data analysis tool** focused on **heatmap visualization for players and teams**, along with data viewing features. If you're interested in **sports analytics and data visualization**, I would love to collaborate with you! ⚽


## **Project Goals**

Our goal is to build a **flexible and interactive** tool that allows users to:  

✅ **View individual player heatmaps** (for a single match, selected matches, or an entire season – e.g., Bellingham’s heatmap for a single La Liga match or the whole season).  

✅ **Compare multiple players’ heatmaps** (display Bellingham vs. Mbappé’s movement in a single game, or even more players, distinguished by different color tones).  

✅ **Generate team-wide heatmaps**, with different tones to differentiate between zones.  

✅ **View basic match data**, such as scores, statistics, and other information that most football software provides (additional content).  

Heatmap comparison and viewing are the core features of this project!


## **Tech Stack (The Basics!)**

The project has already started development, and the website is [https://albertc9.github.io/TactiTrack](https://albertc9.github.io/TactiTrack). We might need:

🟢 **Python** – for data scraping, processing, and visualization.  

🟢 **JavaScript** – to develop the interactive web interface.  

🟢 **CSS** – for basic web design.

🟢 Currently implemented as a static website on GitHub Pages, with future potential to consider server-side use.

🟢 Looking for more people with web design skills (both frontend and backend).


## **Who Are We Looking For?**

👨‍💻 **Developers** (Python/JS) passionate about **data visualization and analytics**.  
📊 **Data Scientists (Potential Future Need)** – skilled in **football data and statistical analysis**.  
⚽ **Football Analysts (Potential Future Need)** – providing **insights and recommendations for tactical applications** for future goals.
