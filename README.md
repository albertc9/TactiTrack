# TactiTrack: 🚀 Recruiting Developers! Let's Build an Open-Source Football Heatmap Analysis Tool Together!  


Hey everyone!  

I'm working on an **open-source football data analysis tool** focused on **heatmap visualization for players and teams**. If you're into **sports analytics, data visualization, or open-source development**, I'd love to collaborate with you! ⚽  

## **Project Goals**  

We aim to build a **flexible and interactive** tool that allows users to:  
✅ **View individual player heatmaps** (for a single match, selected matches, or an entire season – e.g., Bellingham’s heatmap for a single La Liga match or the whole season).  
✅ **Compare multiple players’ heatmaps** (display Bellingham vs. Mbappé’s movement in a single game, or even more players, distinguished by different color tones).  
✅ **Generate team-wide heatmaps**, with different tones to differentiate between zones.  
✅ **Customize visualization** (adjust heat intensity, use different colors for different players, etc.).  
✅ **Support major football data formats** (StatsBomb, Opta, Wyscout, JSON/CSV).  

## **Tech Stack (Flexible & Open to Adjustments!)**  

The project is still in its early ideation phase, and development has not yet begun, but we are looking to start soon. We might need:  

🟢 **Python/C++** (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly) – for data processing & visualization.  
🟢 **JavaScript** (D3.js, Three.js) – if we develop an interactive web interface.  
🟢 **Databases** (PostgreSQL, SQLite) – for efficient match data storage.  
🟢 **Machine Learning (Optional)** – potential future implementation for player movement prediction.  

## **Who Are We Looking For?**  

👨‍💻 **Developers** (Python/JS) passionate about **data visualization & analytics**.  
📊 **Data Scientists (Potential Future Need)** – skilled in **football data & statistical analysis**.  
⚽ **Football Analysts (Potential Future Need)** – providing **insights into tactical applications**.
